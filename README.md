### Workflows for testing BOLDconnectR
The workflows have been written to use BOLDconnectR functionality. Both workflows use all the functions currently available in the package in different combinations. Users need to add the API key at the designated place for the code to work

#### Test data 1
The workflow's test data consists of 715 publicly available records of 62 species from 2 species-rich insect orders Diptera and Lepidoptera (Dataset code: DS-IBOLR24). The data has been compiled so that the records have a wide distribution overall.

#### Test data 2
The test data for the workflow comprises 1,336 process and sample IDs from the Salticidae (Arthropoda:Arachnida:Araneae) family, sourced from Canadian spider data published by Blagoev et al. (2015). This publication includes a DNA barcode reference library encompassing 1,018 species of Canadian spiders.
